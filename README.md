# Sequence-Alignment-Smith-Waterman
Python implementation of the Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment. Compares biological sequences (DNA, RNA, proteins) by constructing a scoring matrix and performing traceback to find optimal local alignments. Includes example runs, scoring schemes, and visualization of alignment results.
